## Welcome to BEhTA Lab at Marquette University

In 2017, Dr. Daniel Pinto became an assistant professor at Marquette University, and brought research projects with him. Over the past year and a half, Dr. Pinto has put work into various projects and studies in order to examine physical therapy techniques, economy around healthcare, and much more. Take a look at our current projects going on and see what we have been up to.
